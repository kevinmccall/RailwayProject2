# Author: Kevin McCall
This is a program that loads in data from a JSON file about railways and
performs an analysis on the data. It can print formatted information about
different routes of railway stations, find the shortest distance between two
stops, provide synopses, etc. The file network.js builds a graph and finds the best routes between multiple stops.

# Usage
run the command `node network.js <filename> <starting station> <ending station> <number of routes>`
- filename is the path to the json file containing the railway data structure.
- starting station is a string containing the name of the starting station
- starting station is a string containing the name of the ending station
- number of routes is the number of best routes returned at maximum

# Functions
- network
    - Creates graph to analyze best routes between stations
- main
    - Entry point to the program

    - Returns an array of the best routes sorted by changes then distance traveled.
